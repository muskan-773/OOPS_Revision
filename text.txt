What is a Class?
:-> A class is a blueprint (design).
:-> what data an object will have
:-> what actions it can perform

It does not occupy memory until an object is created.

Example:
class Student {
    int id;
    String name;

    void show() {
        System.out.println(id + " " + name);
    }
}

What is an Object?
:-> An object is a real instance of a class.
:-> It represents a real-world entity
:-> It occupies memory
:-> Multiple objects can be created from one class

Example:
Student s1 = new Student();
s1.id = 1;
s1.name = "Ritesh";

Student s2 = new Student();
s2.id = 2;
s2.name = "Aman";

Think of an object as a filled form.
